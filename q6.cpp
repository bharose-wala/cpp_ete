//Create a Q6.cpp file.

//Write a code with two subfunctions, each has single objective: to add two numbers, but one can use "+" operator and other one cannot use any operator performing arithmetic operations such as "+", "-", "X or *" and "/".  
//Compare which one is efficient. Take a screenshot of the performance metric outcome when both subfunctions are used to test save as Q6_a_output.jpg and Q6_b_out.jpg if needed.
