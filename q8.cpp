'''Write a C++ code that 
generates an array =[-n, -(n-1), ...., 0, ...., n,-1, n]. 
Saves the positive numbers and negative numbers on your PC hard drive. 
Reads these numbers from hard drive and saves them in another array. 
It evaluates if saving on hard drive is a loss less process.
It estimates if saving was faster or reading back was faster.
Comment on nature of 'n' when loss is significant and show the effect testing the code.'''
