''' Objective: Write a C++ program that compares the execution time of a for loop and a while loop, both performing the same task of calculating the sum of integers from 1 to a large number. Instructions: 
    Task: Write two separate loops: 
    
    The first loop should use a for loop. 
    
    The second loop should use a while loop.
    
    Both loops will perform the same operation: calculate the sum of integers from 1 to a large number (e.g., 100,000,000).

    A brief explanation of the performance differences observed between the for loop and the while loop in terms of execution time.'''
